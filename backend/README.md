I have a long term vision for developing my application which would also be linked with my own AI assistant (to be build later)
so this application I'll start small and keep adding features over time.
so this one would be in java and react. and I don't know react at all
so the first feature I want to create is showing the upcoming important dates and to start with I'll want to show those dates in my react application and also at the java side the entity of user which would have other important and necessary things about a user and also a list with important dates, so the list would have three fields, occasion, date, restricted
and here I'll add details regarding the user..... now I want to also create an api which would try to fetch upcoming dates, and initially what logic I want is to pull details (initially) from user table and get next 2 months data only and store it in redis so that I don't need to call it again and again. also am learning HLD (system design course) in progress so I want to implement design and update my work and design as I learn and get to think of a new feature.

so this is what I have for now and later point am looking into dockerizing it and also implement CI/CD and also deploy to azure cloud and also later try something like lambda, this is what I can think of for the future
also later point I will keep extending this project with several other features, so as you know am learning HLD, cloud and also stocks and finance related stuff, so my next big project before my own AI assistant would be my finance stock helper which would get feed everything I learn from my favourite YouTube channel learning and book that am going to go through which later will help me analyze and help me decide whether to buy or sell or hold or what to do, which later am planning to integrate with my upcoming AI python application (just dreaming) to make my program a full fledge application.
